The last one I have is very complex and covers multiple test cases but also lots of JS theory. It’s fantastic practice but take your time! Let’s do this one properly. I’ll give you the problem and you ask me all the questions you want. I’ll answer them and then you solve it like you would in the interview.

Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.
moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) == [false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]
