Specific Topics of Interest
You should be able to clearly explain the following topics:
assignments and comparison
variable scope, especially how variables interact with function definitions and blocks
function scope
hoisting
primitive values, types and type conversions/coercions
object properties and mutation
understand the differences between loose and strict equality
how passing an argument into a function may or may not permanently change the value that a variable contains or points to
working with Strings, Arrays, and Objects. In particular, you should be thoroughly familiar with the basic Array iteration methods (forEach, map, filter, and find) and how to use Object methods to access the keys and values in an Object as an Array.
understand that arrays are objects, and be able to determine whether you have an Array
variables as pointers
console.log vs return
truthiness: false and true vs. falsy and truthy
function definition and function invocation
function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions
implicit return value of function invocations
first-class functions
partial functon application
side-effects
naming conventions (legal vs idiomatic)
pure functions and side effects

It’s a typical written assessment for sure. We’re expected to learn JS well, all the more the behaviours that are only relevant in JS.
[5:35 AM]
Ainaa said the JS210 test is NOT the same as the JS101 test.  She said pay attention to the traits of Javascript that are specific to Javascript
[5:37 AM]
There is only one 3 hour written test at this level.  The next course has an interview.

Ruby methods are not that similar to Javascript functions in terms of variable scoping rules.  Instead, Javascript functions are more similar to ruby blocks.

// - General questions
//   - Is the type of argument always going to be the same?
//   - Can the function take and handle different types of inputs, such as numbers, strings, booleans, and objects?
//   - What about empty inputs?
//   - Is there a chance that arguments might be omitted or more arguments sent than the function is defined to take?
//   - What should I consider as invalid input and what should we do with them? 

// - Numbers
//   - zeros or leading zeros in strings? if counting leading 0s, what about ending 0s?
//   - if zeros, what about values that evaluate to 0 when coerced into a number?
//   - negative numbers?
//   - fractional numbers (e.g., 0.567)?
//   - special values (e.g., NaN, Infinity)?
//   - can numbers be represented as string digits?

// - Strings
//   - empty string (e.g., '')?
//   - case sensitivity?
//   - only a specific type of char? alphabetic, numeric or special chars?
//   - what about reserved words in string format like undefined or null?
//   - how should we deal with duplicate/repeated chars?
//   - what about leading 0s if string digits?  if counting leading 0s, what about ending 0s?
//   - if words or sentences, how are they delimited? space, multiple spaces, non-alphabetic characters

// - Arrays
//   - Mutate array argument?
//   - empty array(e.g.[])?

LS 185 - where they say don't pick team?  They write, please don't "look" for teammates if you don't already have someone because we have been already formulating teams in the background.

Other student's experience.  She finished in 38 minutes.  Karl was grader.  He said if you finish in 40 minutes or less (and do a good job) A+.  If it takes you 42 or 43 minutes A or A-.  If you're not even close, they'll stop you.

test cases test cases test cases.  Think of all the test cases.

She spent 15 minutes out of her 40 minutes just talking to Karl about the problem.  As she asked questions like, "DOes this take falsy values?"  He would answer, and she would write a test case out in response.

Hardest part of the course is finding the Internet for appropriate level problems. Problems where there are few assumptions and you have to ask interviewer for rules.  The coding is not difficult in and of itself.  The problems provided in the course are too hard or too easy.  She and another student studied together and scoured the internet for problems.  They found problems that were too hard for each other and failed to solve them even the week before the test.  Even the 1000 problem lights problem she still cannot solve.

You have to practice solving the RIGHT problem.  Problem where there are a lot of varying test cases but not very difficult coding-wise.  You could waste a lot of time prepping for the course getting bogged down in code.

Her answer was ONLY 10 lines long.

She was very worried about solving the wrong problem.

He told her there was a test case she didn't account for, and she had 5 minutes to fix it, and she did.

A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A PROBLEM ON THE TEST IS THE COMPARING VERSION NUMBERS problem.  with edge cases.  Assume nothing.

The little exercises are maybe the closest thing in the course?  Best to memorize some coding shortcuts.  How do you check an array is not empty?

Most common character in an array.

Check for an object problems...

Ben's advice for LS215 "This mirrors my experience with it, except for the part about needing to scour for additional problems. What I did instead was take the “easier” small problems and the examples/lesson problems and made them harder by not giving myself the test cases and sometimes adding additional conditions (i.e. i’d ask “the interviewer”/myself if this could accept another type of input and answer “yes” to make it harder - or if it was case insensitive I’d say it was case sensitive to make it harder)"

Rona — 02/03/2022
More of Ben's advice, "Be really organized with your pedac - it helps to jump around when things are in order. It also helps the interviewer follow your thought process
Go in order P-E-D-A - obviously you can jump back, but I’ve seen some others jump ahead too much and then their notes are messy and they miss stuff. Do one step, make sure it is thorough, then move on. Again, you can always revisit but don’t skip around randomly. For me, P is inputs/outputs, rules, questions & edge cases, then I move onto examples/test cases. I do often go through an example during the P phase before I’ve listed all the rules to help understand the problem but I try not to do this first thing after reading the problem, because examples can sometimes throw you off implicit requirements. (edited)
[11:41 AM]
Write out rules and edge cases separately - rules are needed for understanding the problem and making sure you’ve made implicit assumptions/rules explicit, edge cases are listed to ensure you’ve covered them all
Use the edge case list + happy paths as a template - Copy your edge cases down as a template for your test cases. Label each test case with the edge case it represents and group similar cases under the same label. That way, you make sure you’ve got at least one test case for each edge case and haven’t missed any that you came up with. And when you’re testing and one fails, you can immediately see which one because it is labeled (Saves time of parsing what the test case is testing, since many times the differences are subtle). DONT FORGET to include your happy path test cases too if you copy this down - sometimes I even write a happy path section in my P of pedac above edge cases to make sure I get them too.
Ask lots of questions - Especially ask if your understanding of the problem is correct once you, if your test case makes sense and if the output you expect is correct.
For questions about the inputs, I like to think from the outermost data type inward
For example, if the input is an array of objects, I start with just the fact that there is input first:
What if no input is given, what if it’s not an array, etc.
Then I move to the array
What if the array is empty, has empty items, etc
Then I move to the"
[11:41 AM]
the array
What if the array is empty, has empty items, etc
Then I move to the array elements
will they always be objects, etc
Then to the objects themselves
keys, values, duplicate values, same object twice etc.
Don’t forget to look for problem specific edge cases - this is the hardest thing to do. But you can’t just rattle off the list from your notes, you’ve got to think about this specific problem
[11:44 AM]
Make the test cases return true/false if possible
If the problem allows, compare the return value of your test case with a boolean and output that result vs outputting the return value
i.e. console.log(mySolution(input) === 'the expected result');
negative case: console.log(mySolution(badInput) === 'this is bad');
This way, you’re able to see true and false for your test cases when they run, vs having to manually compare the results to the expectation. More accurate and faster
[11:46 AM]
Walk through the algorithm with a test case if time allows. If you’ve got enough time, do a good case and a bad case/edge case you want to make sure is covered. This has solved many problems for me before coding and I’ve seen people miss entire edge cases that they knew about, but catch it during algorithm by doing this.
My other algorithm preference is to physically write out what the data structure I’m using at each step is. That way I can see it vs having to hold it in my brain. Especially helpful for dealing with those tricky bugs where you forget a simple language syntax thing or method return value and when dealing with nested data structures like arrays of arrays

Ainaa's suggested problems Josephus Survivor is a hard one. I don’t think anyone should expect to really finish it in 40 minutes, but instead should focus on understanding and just solving the problem regardless of how long it takes.

Anti Array is a really good one. It’s actually on the easier side but it’s really good for thinking about what could be edge cases for this problem and how to solve those edge cases as well. For example, what if you had NaN in the array.

This one is a tricky question that is really good to practice with. Not sure where it came from.
You know how sometimes you write the the same word twice in a sentence, but then don't notice that it happened? For example, you've been distracted for a second. Did you notice that "the" is doubled in the first sentence of this description?

As as aS you can see, it's not easy to spot those errors, especially if words differ in case, like "as" at the beginning of this sentence.

Write a function that counts the number of sections repeating the same word (case insensitive). The occurrence of two or more equal words next after each other counts as one.


countAdjacentPairs('') // 0
countAdjacentPairs('orange Orange kiwi pineapple apple') //1
countAdjacentPairs('orange Orange kiwi pineapple apple') //1
countAdjacentPairs('banana banana banana') // 1

This one is also very tricky and good practice.

Josephus Survivor
In this kata you have to correctly return who is the "survivor", ie: the last element of a Josephus permutation.
Basically you have to assume that n people are put into a circle and that they are...

Yoorhim's advice for problems to solve to replicate LS215 interview: Hey Rona--I was looking through the problems, and I actually think the list processing problems are good ones to practice ( #8 - 10), but maybe level up by also incorporating scenarios for different data types or even returning different format of the answers. Like, for the Inventory Item one, instead of returning the array of transaction items, what if you had to return them in some order or return only the values, etc.

Ask the right questions:
1) With valid input, what should I return? (Return undefined if it's valid and just log the star pattern to the console.)
2) Didn't spend enough time in the example portion because when you were writing the algorithm.  Don't GO TO ALGORITHM UNTIL I SEE THE PATTERN.
3) You got lost in your code.  Too long.  Write shorter code.  Slow down. So you don't get lost, take algorithm, copy it, post algorithm write above it.
4)
