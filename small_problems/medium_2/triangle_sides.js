- I think it could help in the example phase, Instead of reading there explaination of the example. To write out your own explaination and compare it to theirs to make sure your understanding matches the provided explaination.
- When you were writing the helper function part of your array you wrote "return true" where as in the code you wrote return []. Maybe just update it in your algo if you notice you were wrong originally.
- Make sure when testing your helper function test both cases that will pass and fail.
- After you realized that "oh we need to do n+1" you probably should have confirmed that the code looked how you were imagining it.
- When you move on from building the array, you do not follow your algorithm. In the algorithm you wrote "At array[0], assign "irrelevant". You did not do that in your code. You should either make sure your code matches your algorithm or update the algorithm if you're understanding of the problem changes.
- Saying "I think that this is it", but you haven't finished all of the logic written in your algorithm.
- Make sure that the output you want at each part is right before you start the next part of the algorithm. (switching the lights on and off was not working properly when you started filtering).
- Pay attention to === and = (equality vs Reassignment)
- If you are getting the wrong output. Log all your variables and make sure they match what you think they should
- When you were being thrown off by the 0 index and having to add slice to your code it is because you ignored a part of your algorithm, - too much hack and slash.
- Be sure to understand the array methods, such as filter, map
Rona â€” 02/09/2022
Biggest Mistakes: if they give you a very thorough example, understand it YOURSELF first before reading their description
In the examples section, write out what's happening
Anne: When you're breaking down a specific example and writing down the steps to get to the output, that will help get to the algorithm in the code

// Triangle Sides
// A triangle is classified as follows:

// Equilateral: All three sides are of equal length.
// Isosceles: Two sides are of equal length, while the third is different.
// Scalene: All three sides are of different lengths.
// To be a valid triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides must be greater than the length of the longest side, and every side must have a length greater than 0. If either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.

// Write a function that takes the lengths of the three sides of a triangle as arguments and returns one of the following four strings representing the triangle's classification: 'equilateral', 'isosceles', 'scalene', or 'invalid'.

// Examples:
/*
Problem: Write a function that takes the lengths of the 3 sides of a triangle as arguments and returns  one of the following four strings representing the triangle's classification.

rules/requirements:
explicit:
1) Equilateral means all 3 sides are of equal length.
2) Isosceles: 2 sides are of equal length, 3rd different.
3) Scalene - all 3 sides are of differeng lengths.
4) Valid Triangle - sum of the lengths of the 2 shortest sides must be greater than the length of the longest side AND every side must have a length greater than 0. 
5) 

implicit:
1) Will always be given 3 arguments.
2) Can be given non-integer numbers.
3) Can be given 0 as an argument, but that's an invalid input anyways.
4) 

input: 3 numbers
output: string or false

questions:
1) What if pass in invalid data type?( Return false)
2) What if pass in non integer number? (It's an acceptable number as long as it's greater than 0.)
3) What if you pass in too many arguments?  (only use first 3)
4) What if yu pass in not enough arguments? (Return false)
5) What if you pass in Infinity? (Return false)
6) What about NaN? (It's not a valid number, so return false)

Examples/test cases:
console.log(triangle(3, 3, 3));        // "equilateral"
console.log(triangle(3, 3, 1.5));      // "isosceles"
console.log(triangle(3, 4, 5));        // "scalene"
console.log(triangle(0, 3, 3));        // "invalid" // invalid because one of the 3 sides is 0
console.log(triangle(3, 1, 1));        // "invalid" // invalid because sum of 2 sides is less than 3rd
console.log(triangle(3, 4, 5, 6)); // "scalene"

console.log(triangle()) // false
console.log(triangle('', 3, 6)) // false
console.log(triangle([], 2, 3)) // false
console.log(triangle({}, 5, 6)) // false
console.log(triangle(undefined, 5, 6)) // false
console.log(triangle(3, 4, 5, 6)) "scalene"
console.log(triangle((2, 3))) // false
console.log(triangle((Infinity, 4, 5))) // false

Data structures:

Input:  3 positive numbers

Intermediate data structures: 

output: String indicating equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or "invalid"

Algorithm:

-Declare a function `triangle` that takes 3 numbers `num1`, `num2`, `num3`.
  -Declare `holder` to [...args] and hold all 3 arguments
  -Pass `holder` to `isValidDataType` to make sure all elements are numbers and NOT Infinity and greater than 0

  -Pass `holder` to `isValidTriangle`
  
  -if num1 === num2 === num3
    return "equilateral"
  -if num1 === num2 || num2 === num3 || num1 === num3
    return "isosceles"
  -else return "scalene"
  
 
-Helper function `isValidTriangle`
  -Must check that the sum of 2 sides is greater than the third side
  -if first and second side are less than 3rd side, return false
  -if second and third side are less than first side, return false
  -if first and third side are less than second side, return false
  -otherwise return true
  
  
-Helper function `isValidDataType`
  -Check all elements are numbers
  -Check all numbers are NOT Infinity
  -Check all numbers are greater than 0.
  -Check number is NOT NaN.
